# Ignoring I2C and SPI from STM32 repository is hacky and awful, but we've
# been maintaining our own versions of these files awhile.  At least this 
# leaves the cube SDK unmolested, as we now maintain our own copies of these
# files in our HAL implementation.  
# I'm ignoring the files as the symbols would otherwise conflict -- this needs
# to be improved.
